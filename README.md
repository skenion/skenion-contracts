# skenion Contracts

Versioned contracts, schemas, generated protocol packages, and conformance tests for skenion.

This repository is the source of truth for TypeScript/Rust communication contracts.
Human-readable delivery and processing model docs live in
[skenion/skenion-docs](https://github.com/skenion/skenion-docs).

## Contract Surfaces

- Protobuf + Buf for live runtime control messages.
- JSON Schema for persisted graph and project documents.
- JSON Schema for node definition manifests.
- OpenAPI for HTTP runtime surfaces such as health, snapshots, assets, and diagnostics.
- Golden fixtures and conformance tests for TypeScript/Rust compatibility.
- Typed node interfaces for value, event, stream, and resource ports.

The active graph/project contract is v0.1. Runtime-authoritative session
snapshots expose `ProjectDocumentV01` at `RuntimeSessionSnapshot.project`;
active graph mutation surfaces use `RuntimeOperationEnvelope`,
`GraphTargetRef`, and `GraphFragmentV01`. The v0.1 label is the current rich
graph shape, including patch libraries, graph fragments, view state,
extension-provided nodes, and runtime operation/collaboration contracts. Older
v0.1 graph/project/patch compatibility and migration helpers are not active
contract surfaces.

Typed object boxes preserve user-entered `objectText`; Runtime resolution maps
that text to implementation kinds and diagnostics without making unresolved text
a separate user-facing node class.

See [Node Interface](docs/node-interface.md) for the initial node and port type
model, and [Script Nodes](docs/script-nodes.md) for the script node manifest
boundary.
For design review of how values, messages, audio, video, render frames, and GPU
resources move through the system, start with the
[skenion Docs data delivery model](https://github.com/skenion/skenion-docs/blob/main/docs/model/data-delivery-model.md).
Object text parse outputs are defined in
[Object Text Parser Contract](docs/object-text-parser.md). The first audio DSP
contract baseline is documented in
[Audio DSP Contract Baseline](docs/audio-dsp-contract.md).

## Initial Validation

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run ci
```

For sibling-repository source integration, build the local package and capture
machine-readable evidence for the consumer issue or PR:

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run local-integration:evidence
```

The evidence command prints JSON with the local TypeScript package path/version,
the required `dist/index.js` and `dist/index.d.ts` entries, the Rust crate
path/version, and the current git branch, commit, and dirty state. It fails
without publishing or mutating release state when required local build outputs
are missing. Committed dependency manifests remain registry-first; sibling
repositories should use this evidence only for explicit unreleased source
integration work.

For CI parity on release and workflow changes, also run the Rust package gates:

```bash
cargo metadata --manifest-path packages/rust/Cargo.toml --locked --format-version 1 >/dev/null
cargo package --manifest-path packages/rust/Cargo.toml --locked --no-verify
cargo fmt --check --manifest-path packages/rust/Cargo.toml
cargo clippy --manifest-path packages/rust/Cargo.toml --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo llvm-cov --manifest-path packages/rust/Cargo.toml --all-targets --all-features --fail-uncovered-lines 0 --fail-under-functions 100
git diff --exit-code -- packages/rust/Cargo.lock
```

## Status

Bootstrap repository for the skenion project. Implementation follows the public architecture and release rules defined in [skenion/skenion](https://github.com/skenion/skenion).

The `@skenion/contracts` npm package and `skenion-contracts` Rust crate remain
publishable release artifacts because they are importable contract and validator
libraries. Publishing still runs only through GitHub Actions release workflows.

Contracts packages also export canonical v0 compatibility-line helpers and the
`skenion.compatibility-matrix` schema/types/validators. The compatibility
matrix records Contracts package identity, SDK-supported Contracts ranges,
component versions, and protocol baselines. Runtime/Studio release artifacts,
checksums, S3 locations, promotion gates, and product release-set completeness
belong to the repositories and workflows that produce those artifacts, not to
the Contracts package.
