# Skenion Contracts

Versioned contracts, schemas, generated protocol packages, and conformance tests for Skenion.

This repository is the source of truth for TypeScript/Rust communication contracts.

## Contract Surfaces

- Protobuf + Buf for live runtime control messages.
- JSON Schema for persisted graph and project documents.
- JSON Schema for node definition manifests.
- OpenAPI for HTTP runtime surfaces such as health, snapshots, assets, and diagnostics.
- Golden fixtures and conformance tests for TypeScript/Rust compatibility.
- Typed node interfaces for value, event, stream, and resource ports.
